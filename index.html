				<h4 class="h-4">India, Russia on the same page on Taliban-ruled Kabul</h4>
				<p>
					While Russia was understandably happy at the humiliating exit of US forces from Afghanistan, delight was short-lived as the reality of a terror force ruling Afghanistan at the behest of Pakistan dawned in. Even though Russia still maintains an embassy in Kabul, Moscow, like India, is very seriously concerned about the long-term security impact of the Islamist Sunni Pashtun regime in Afghanistan.<br>
					India has forcefully put forward its assessment and concerns over Islamist Taliban ruled Afghanistan to visiting US, UK intelligence chiefs and will convey the same today to visiting Russian security czar. The Taliban 2.0 is no different from its previous avatar.

				<p>
					In a historic move, the centre today told the Supreme Court that women will be admitted into the National Defence Academy (NDA) for permanent commission into India's armed forces. The government, however, said it needs some time to frame guidelines to pave the way for women to take NDA courses. The Supreme Court has told the centre to file its reply by September 20.<br>
					"We are extremely glad to know that the armed forces themselves took the decision to induct women into the NDA. We know that reforms cannot happen in a day... The government will place timelines of the process and the course of action," the Supreme Court said today while hearing a petition for allowing women to take NDA and Naval Academy exams.

				<p>
					Sri Lanka’s parliament has approved a state of emergency declared by the president, who said it is needed to control food prices and prevent hoarding amid shortages of some staples.<br>
					The emergency law enables authorities to detain people without warrants, seize property, enter and search any premises, suspend laws and issue orders that cannot be questioned in court. Officials who issue such orders are also immune from lawsuits.<br>
					In recent weeks, there have been shortages of essential items such as sugar, milk powder and cooking gas. The government says hoarders artificially created the shortages.<br>
